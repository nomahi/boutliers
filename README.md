## Outlier detection and influence diagnostics for meta-analysis

A R package for implementing outlier detection and influence diagnostics for meta-analysis:

- Studentized residuals by leave-one-out analysis
- Likelihood ratio test using a mean-shifted model
- The VRATIO statistic (relative change of the variance of the overall estimator) by leave-one-out analysis
- The TAU2RATIO statistic (relative change of the heterogeneity variance) by leave-one-out analysis

Bootstrap distributions of the influence statistics are calculated by simple codes, and the thresholds to determine outliers are clearly provided.
